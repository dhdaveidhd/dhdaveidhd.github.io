    <p>My long-term goal is to start my own software startup here in NZ. I would like to have the technical ability to create at least a working prototype and understand code, thus I have chosen to come to Dev Academy to gain those skills and experiences. My strengths in regard to learning are that I am a fast learner, I’m open-minded and adaptive as well as a good eye for detail. My weaknesses in the past have included being quick to give up on learning concepts when I don’t get grasp them immediately and the lack of an organised and consistent work schedule. I also struggled to stay focused for extended periods of time during my prior studies. I have become increasingly aware of these weaknesses and will try my best to address and overcome them during this course. 
    </p>
    <p>The most important human skill I would like to learn is the intricacies of working in a team environment to ensure maximum productivity. As my long-term goal is to found my own startup, I would like to learn what it is like to work in a well-functioning team, both as a team member as well as a leader. This will help me understand the perspectives from both sides, which will help me better manage a development team later on in my career hopefully. I will manage myself to work productively by setting a consistent work schedule and being respectful of other learners throughout the entire course. To ensure that I am working productively, I will be allocated a set number of hours a day dedicated to this course and programming. During working, I will be using a Pomodoro clock, where I will be working in 30-minute chunks - resting for 25 minutes and resting for 5 minutes. This is done to keep me feeling fresh and energetic. I will also be conducting both a morning and evening reflection daily, where I would be setting the daily goals and reflecting on the lessons learnt. 
    </p>
    <p>I will seek help after I have encountered a problem and I have given it my best shot to solve it personally. I will attempt to solve the problem first by going through my existing knowledge base. If that fails, then I will try to find resources online that will help me solve it. If after 30 minutes I still am not able to solve it, then I will ask for help first on the discord channel with other students in the cohort. Lastly, I will seek assistance from facilitators. Finally, I would want the facilitation team to be available for me to seek assistance when a problem is too difficult to solve and I’ve tried all other methods. It would also be great if facilitators could provide useful past development experiences from both a personal and professional standpoint.
