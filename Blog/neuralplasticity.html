        I believe truly understanding how Neuroplasticity works can really help a person’s mindset towards learning, which can drastically change the results. Using myself as an example, I used to believe in the concept that a person’s brain after the age of 25 stops developing, and it becomes extremely difficult to learn new skills. This has caused me a lot of regret in the past as I was dwelling on wasting a lot of my teens not learning new skills. After doing more research on this subject, I realised that people can learn new skills at any age, which has reduced my time dwelling, and instead helped me focus on learning new skills.
        
        A good way to increase neuralplasticity is to constantly be learning new things and practicing, so new connections are constantly being made. Knowing all of this now, I will always keep and open mind and learn new skills to increase my neural plasticity throughout my life. A resource I found really useful was this website: https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/ - which contains great explanations and some good exercises.

      <p>In my childhood, I always had the fixed mindset, where I was either told I was smart at something or that I was talented. I believed that majority of becoming good at something was down to natural talent instead of hard work. That has really deterred me from learning new skills, as I would give up really quickly if I didn’t immediately understand a topic, excusing it with thinking I just wasn’t naturally gifted at this skill. I think learning about growth mindset was incredibly beneficial for me, as it would it for many people. A lot of kids growing up was always complimented with the phrase “you are so smart” instead of “you worked so hard for this”. In the future, I will adopt a more growth focused mindset, where I would always keep the belief that I can always learn new skills as long as I just consistently worked on it, instead of relying purely on natural talent. A resource I found really useful was this website: https://www.youcubed.org/evidence/believe-brain-operates-differently/ 
      </p>
      <p>Overall, I would integrate this knowledge into having more confidence and patience for my learning. I will have the belief and confidence that I can definitely learn anything I want, as long as I worked hard at the problem. Knowing that learning a new skill isn’t purely relying on natural talent, I will also be much more patient when learning something new, and not give up at the first roadblock.
