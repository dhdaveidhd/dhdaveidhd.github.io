      <p>The problem was that I could not figure out shy my switch statement couldnâ€™t work. To solve the problem, I put in some console.log into each switch case to check if each part of the code was being run. When that did not work, I went to googling the problem to see code examples, which really helped me solve the problem. Initially, In was understandably a little bit frustrated as I had previously used switch statements successfully. I learnt that I should pass the right variable into the switch statement and write each case correctly, and to be open to googling instead of trying to brute force a fix.
      </p>
      <p>Another problem I encountered was variables not being recognised. The problem solving technique I initially used was trying to was rewriting the code in a different way which also did not work. I then read the error message which made me aware that the variable name was unrecognised. I did some more online research and found that JS variables are block scoped, and that I defined the variable outside of the block I was trying to use it in, which I have now learnt and will apply in the future.

      </p>
      <p>I feel quite confident writing pseudocode, especially after extensive practice during the javascript cafe challenge. I believe that pre-planning the functionality of the code really helps streamline the process and helps reduce the potential for error in future implementation fo the actual codebase.



        I feel confident now trying new things to try figure out what is wrong with the code. I especially enjoy putting console.logs at places to see if that section of the code is being run or working properly. I have also gotten used to reading error messages and have become better at interpreting them.
        
        
        
        I think currently my favourite technique is googling the problem and finding previous examples from sites such as stack overflow. I believe that this is currently the most effective method for me. 
        
        
        
        Lastly, I have not had to ask me peers or coaches for help up to this point in the course, but I know I will have to during the bootcamp. Thus, I have prepared and am very willing to ask for help when it is required.</p>
