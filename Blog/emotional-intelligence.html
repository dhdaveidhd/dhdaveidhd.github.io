      <p>Simply expressed, EQ refers to a person's awareness of his or her own emotions as well as his or her capacity to use that understanding in real-life settings. What is your level of self-awareness? And do whetherÂ you put that knowledge to good use in your daily life?

        EQ is defined as "your ability to detect and comprehend emotions in yourself and others, and your ability to use this awareness to control your behaviour and relationships" in the well-known book "Emotional Intelligence 2.0."

      </p>
      <p>IQ used to be used to assess your logic, reasoning, analytical, and problem-solving abilities, but it is now used to score your logic, reasoning, analytical, and problem-solving abilities. It's critical for planning and strategizing, as well as science, math, and other cognitively demanding pursuits.
        EQ on the otherhand, addresses the parts of your brain that are involved for recognising emotions, demonstrating empathy, adapting to changing situations, settling conflicts, and effectively communicating. 
      </p>
      <p>People are becoming more aware of the value of EQ in today's world, particularly in the professional setting. Students with higher levels of empathy, for example, appear to obtain better scores in business and vocations, even if their peers are equally intelligent. This is because they can better manage their emotions (for example, being bored while doing schoolwork) and perform better in social situations (for example, knowing when to talk and when to be silent in class).
