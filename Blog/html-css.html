      <p>For this week's technical blog, I decided to write about the difference between 
        using classes vs ID's as a CSS selector. I chose this topic as I was initially confused 
        to the difference, and the best time to use each of them. Thus, I have chosen to create this blog.
      </p>
      <p>The ID selector is used for an HTML element that is competely unique. That is,
        you only plan to use this styling once for this particular element. An example would be
        if you want the logo of your blog to be unique, but you don't plan to use it anywhere other 
        than once on the main home page, then ID is the best option for that scenario.
      </p>
      <p>The class selector is used for HTML elements that you plan to use more than once. 
        This could be the layout of the navigation bar, or the style of the staff profiles.
      </p>
      <p>Overall, the main difference between ID and classes is that ID's are meant to be applied to elements once,
        while classes are desgineed for elements that will be shared multiple times. For code readbility, using each
        for their designed scenario would be best practice moving forward in web dev.
