      <p>HTML/CSS and its relationship to Javascript? <br>

        To use buildings as an analogy, each building has multiple attributes. The attributes are the structure of the building, the appearance and decor of the building, and the actual functions of the building.
        
        HTML would define the structure of the building, for example, whether it's an apartment or house.
        
        CSS defines the decor of the house, like what colour it would be and what architectural style.
        
        Javascript determines the functionality of the building and how its visitors interact with it, for example, whether it's a home or a shopping mall. 
                 
      </p>
      <p>What are control flow and loops? <br>

        Control flow is the order in which functions or statements gets executed by the program. A real-life example would be getting out of the house and starting a car. The control flow would go like: first operation would be to unlock the car, then get in, turn the car on using keys, then check your engine lights etc. <br>
        
        Loop is a statement that basically states that this operation would be repeated until a certain condition is met. For example, if your goal was to unload all five bags of groceries from your car, then you would repeat the unloading process five times until all of the groceries were in your house.
      </p>
      <p>What is DOM and how do you interact with it? <br>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a way of representing the structure of a "document." That "document" in the context of JavaScript is usually an HTML document.

        The concept is that a document can be represented as a tree, with 'elements' that can include optional 'attributes' and 'children.' A root node called 'html', for example, exists in an HTML document. It's possible that it has an attribute like 'lang' (the language used) and children like 'head' and 'body.' As a result, the 'body' element would have children.
        
        An example of interacting with the DOM is if I want to change the colour of a specific text area that has an ID using document.getElementByID(“ID”).style.color = ‘blue’
        
        
      </p>
      <p>What is the difference between objects and arrays? <br>

        Both objects and arrays are used to store data, and both are mutable. The way they store it, however, is quite different. An array stores the data in a list, and you can access it by specifying the index (ie. the order of the element). Arrays are best used for storing a list of multiple items in a single variable, but they don’t need to have special identifiers. 
            
        An object is best used when you want to store information about particular elements that can be defined with a special identifier called a key. For example, if you’re an website and want to store information such as email address, name and age about a customer, you would define it as such: 
            
            var person = {
             name: 'Zac',
             age: 33,
             Email address: abcd@gmail.com
            };
            
            To access an attribute from an object, you would have to know both the object and key name. 
        </p>
        <p>What is a function and why is it useful? <br>

              Functions are "self-contained" code modules that perform a single purpose. Data is often "taken in," processed, and a result is "returned" by functions. Once you've written a function, you can use it over and over again. It's possible to "call" functions from within other functions.
              
              A function is similar to a mini-program that may be written independently of the main programme without having to consider the remainder of the programme. This allows us to break down a complex programme into smaller, more understandable portions, reducing the program's overall complexity.
