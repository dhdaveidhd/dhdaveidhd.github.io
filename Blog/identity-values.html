      <p>A person's identity is shaped by a variety of factors. Family, culture, friends, personal interests, and the environment all contribute to the formation of a person's identity. Some factors may have a greater impact than others, while others may have no impact at all. Many areas of a person's life are influenced as they grow up in a family. Family and culture can have an impact on a person's feeling of responsibility, ethics and morality, musical preferences, sense of humour, sports preferences, and many other elements of life.</p>
      <p>A personal value of mine that is important to me is generosity. There was a time when I was travelling overseas, and I ran into a young child selling flowers. As I did not have any cash on me at the time, I couldn't buy one. The child instead gave me a flower for free and said "don't forget about me, have a good day". The moment has really stuck with me and I think about it all the time.</p>
      <p>An example where I struggled working in a team was during university, where a team member simply wasn't working very hard and deviating from the project requirements. At that tinme, I was frustrated and refused to communicate with them, instead relegating to working on the project by myself. If I were to travel back in time, I think it would be have been great to openly communicate wth them to understand their point of view and situation, and subsequently working to find an optimum solution. This has taught me the importance of collabration and teamwork, which is an important skill that I would love to develop at Dev Academy.
