      <p>Three things that I learned about myself during the bootcamp was the fact that I am quite a capable self-learner, the fact that having a stubborn ego will be incredibly detrimental to progressing in my career/life, and finally be open to giving as well as receiving help.

        I think having a empathetic mindset when it comes to programming is incredibly important. Computers don't understand our language, so coders translate human instructions into programming languages computers can understand and carry out. Empathy is the action of understanding, being aware of and being sensitive to the feelings of others. It is a valuable entrepreneurial skill as it enables people to identify problems others may be facing and, from there, develop solutions.

        The part that has surprised me most about the core learning is how useful it actually is and how big of an impact it has made on my leaning journey. At the beginning of the foundations course, I was a little bit skeptical of it, as I thought it was mainly just meditation or mindfulness practicing. But after going through it all, I have found that they have truly made an impact on the quality of my learning process.

      <p>
        For me, the hardest part of the core learning has been to truly implement it everyday and be mindful of it. It can be really easy to do something for a few days, but to truly make it a habit and doing it consistently has been quite a challenge. Thankfully, I have continued to practice on it and will continue to do so once bootcamp starts. 
      </p>

        I believe the reason that we spend so much time learning about core skills is quite evident, as it really helps with the learning process as well as ensure that we are a more complete developer by the end of the course. Being a developer takes more than just pure programming skills, as human skills, the ability to work in a team and the problem-solving process all contribute to being a great developer. Hence, I believe that it is great that Dev Academy is spending so much time for us to learn it and it is definitely not a waste of time.
